# NAVIGATION SYSTEM
Including mapping(ORBslam2)„ÄÅ planner and action module code.

## Prerequisites

### Mapping module
We have tested the library in **ubuntu 20.04**, but it should be easy to compile on other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

- #### C++11 or C++0x Compiler

    We use the new thread and Chrono functionalities of C++11.

- #### Pangolin

    We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Download and install instructions can be found at: <https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin>.

- #### OpenCV

    We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Download and install instructions can be found at: <http://opencv.org>. **Required at least 4.0+. Tested with OpenCV 4.2.0**.

- #### Eigen3

    It is required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org>. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

- #### DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)

    We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

- #### Pcl

    We use [pcl](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl) library for point cloud generation and saving. **Tested with pcl 1.10.0**.

- #### ROS

    Finally, we completed the linkage (communication) between all modules through [ROS](ros.org).

### planner

- #### ompl

    We use [ompl](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/) to plan motion in the occupancy map generated by the mapping module. ***Note that you need to activate --python(like this "./install-ompl-ubuntu.sh --python") to ensure Python bindings compilation***.
    some **Notice** is [here](planner/README.md).

### action module

***Note that this module only supports the Aliengo(unitree) robot.***   
*This code _has already been prepared on the Aliengo in ~/code/catkin_ws, the instructions for running this module are [here.](catkin_ws/README.md)*

- #### Aligengo lib

    ```
    Legged_sport    >= v1.0.20
    firmware H0.1.7 >= v0.1.35
    H0.1.9          >= v0.1.35
    ```

- #### Boost

    [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (version 1.5.4 or higher)

- #### LCM

    [LCM](https://lcm-proj.github.io) (version 1.4.0 or higher)
